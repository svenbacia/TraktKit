This was a pleasant surprise because it was casted perfectly, specially Clayne Crawford as Riggs. The chemistry between the cast is also perfect, and I love that Trish is not a stay at home mom and has her own career.\r\nGood amount of drama, action and comedy.

The thematic and emotional jumps that come out of nowhere. It's a mess, despite a good chemistry between the leads and the excellent acting from Clayne Crawford. What I like the most is that instead of channeling Gibson, he made his own character tick. The weak parts of his acting are sadly when he tries to incorporate the film's canon. Every time he goes for those moments, the character feels cheap. He shines when he delivers his sincere southern charisma. They need to get rid of the shadow of the movies, and depart from them. As far as possible, so this series gets its own voice. Then again, this is Fox, and it'll get cancelled after one season, anyway.

Crawford and Damon Wayans also have some good chemistry. Lethal Weapon has some pretty great action for a tv show as well.\r\nI liked Rush Hour and it was a guilty pleasure of mine. Lethal Weapon has more going for it though. Since there's some heart felt drama as well.
